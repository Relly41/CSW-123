        <p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center; color: red; ">Officials warned of almost instant frostbite as <b>temperatures</b> in the region plunged below zero Wednesday. Some state offices are closed and postal workers won't deliver mail in 10 states. Thousands of flights have been canceled along with dozens of train services -- most of them in and out of Chicago.</p>
        
        <p style="color: red; "><mark>Climate</mark> is the statistics of weather over long periods of time.[1][2] It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. <mark>Climate</mark> differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. <br/> A region's <mark>climate</mark> is generated by the <mark>climate</mark>system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere.[3] <br/> The <mark>climate</mark> of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. <mark>Climates</mark> can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the KÃ¶ppen <mark>climate</mark> classification. The Thornthwaite system,[4] in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how <mark>climate</mark> change affects it. The <del>Bergeron and Spatial</del> Synoptic <ins>Classification systems</ins> focus on the origin of air masses that define the <mark>climate</mark> of a region.</p>
