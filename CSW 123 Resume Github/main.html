                <h2>Original Rules of Basketball</h2>
                    <p>The game had 13 original rules created by Naismith.</p> 
                        <ol>
                        <li>The ball could be thrown in any direction with one hand or both hands.</li> 
                        <li>The ball could also be battled in any direction by one hand or with both hands.</li>
                        <li>Players could not run with the ball, and they must throw it from the spot on which it is caught. Although there were loopholes around when a player is running at a good speed when they catch it.</li>
                        <li>The ball had to be held in the hands, arms or body could not be used to hold the ball.</li> 
                        <li>No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking opponents allowed. The first infringement of this rule counts as a foul, and the second disqualifies the player until the next goal, or if it is evident that there was no intent to cause harm.</li> 
                        <li>A foul is striking the ball with the fist.</li>
                        <li>If either side makes three consecutive fouls, then this is counted as a goal for opponents.</li>
                        <li>A goal is made when the ball is thrown or battled from the ground and into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge, and if opponents move the basket, this also counts as a goal. </li>
                        <li>Should the ball go out of bounds, then it shall be thrown into the field and played by the first person to touch it. The person who throws it in is allowed five seconds to do so, if they hold it any longer it goes to the opponent. </li>
                        <li>Umpires shall be the judge of men and will note fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.</li>
                        <li>The referee judges the ball and decides when the ball is in play, in-bounds and to which side it belongs. They also keep the time and divide when a goal has been made and keep account of these. </li>
                        <li>The time is fifteen-minute halves, with a five-minute rest between. </li>
                        <li>The side making the most goals in the time aforementioned will be the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may be continued until another goal is made.</li>
